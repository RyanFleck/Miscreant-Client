# Miscreant

A small game to test if I can make a simple networked game. _Supports all 2D build targets!_

Corresponding backend is <https://github.com/RyanFleck/Miscreant-Backend>

## Iteration 2 Notes

Basic websocket backend deployed and working on Heroku. Hooray!

Frontend has no graphics at the moment, but a game on top of this network layer will be implemented soon.

## Iteration 1 Notes

TCP backend worked fine locally but could not be deployed to Heroku.
